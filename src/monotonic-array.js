Q: An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.
   An array is monotone increasing if all its elements from left to right are non-decreasing.
   An array is monotone decreasing if all its elements from left to right are non-increasing.
   Given an integer array return true if the given array is monotonic, or false otherwise.


Example 1:
  Input: nums = [1,2,2,3]
  Output: true
Example 2:
  Input: nums = [6,5,4,4]
  Output: true
Example 3:
  Input: nums = [1,3,2]
  Output: false

Constraints:
  1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
  -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
